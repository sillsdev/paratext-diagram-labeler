                <p>This is beta software primarily intended to test the user experience for integration into Paratext 10.

                <h2 class="section-title">Purpose</h2>
                <p>The Labeler is a tool to prepare labels for maps and other diagrams to be used in a Paratext project. 
                It helps ensure that the labels you use on maps and diagrams in Map Creator or Adobe InDesign actually 
                match the terms used in your Scripture text.</p>
                
                <p>Note that while the work is done in a graphical layout, the goal is not to create an image, but to 
                collect the labels to be used on a map or diagram in either Map Creator or InDesign.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A project's <strong>Term Renderings</strong> is where the Labeler will look for text to use in labels.</li>
                        
                        <li>Wherever possible, it looks for the term ID as used in Paratext's Major Biblical Terms list, generally a single Greek or Hebrew word. E.g. ŒùŒ±Œ∂Œ±œÅŒ¨ for Nazareth.</li>
                        
                        <li>In some cases, a label such as "Mediterranean Sea" does not have a corresponding word in the source texts, and so a term ID like "mediterranean_sea" is used instead. This is fairly transparent to the user.</li>
                        
                        <li>You store your labels in the Term Renderings so that they will be automatically available on other maps and diagrams. The <a href="#working-with-labels">color-coded statuses</a> will help to ensure that you've done this consistently. However, you are free to export and use labels no matter what status they have. You may have valid reasons not to match the label used for the same location on a different map. E.g. A place is labeled "Mizpah" on one map, but "Mizpah of Moab" on another. But the status will at least make you aware of the difference.</li>
                        
                        <li>There are two ways that you can save diagram labels for later use:</li>

                    <h3>Method 1: IDML Data Merge Files</h3>
                    <p>You can export all the labels for a diagram into an IDML data merge file, which is the format from which you could merge them into an IDML diagram. It is recommended that you save these in the <code>shared\\labeler</code> folder within your project folder, so that they are included in your send/receive.</p>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Method 2: USFM Representation</h3>
                    <p>You can save the USFM representation of the diagram in any appropriate location in your Paratext project, just like you do with \\fig fields to store illustration information. (It is not tied to chapters and verses in an XX book, as was the case with the Scripture Map Labeler.) For this, you must currently copy and paste between the USFM in/out control and your Paratext project. (For the Paratext 10 extension, this would be automatic.) However, the USFM representation has not been finalized, and may change, so it's recommended that for the time being, you store your diagram labels in IDML data merge files.</p>

The <strong>zoom buttons</strong> <span class="maroonOval">2</span> enable zooming in and out on the diagram.</p>
                
                <p>In the <strong>details pane</strong> on the right, the <strong>view buttons</strong> <span class="maroonOval">3</span> enable you to select between "map view", "table view", and "USFM view" to be shown in the main pane.</p>
                
                <p>The <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> buttons <span class="maroonOval">4</span> will return you to the pre-launch screen, with or without updating the USFM representation there.</p>

                    <li><strong style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 0.8em;">Export to Data Merge File</strong>: Use this to save your current diagram to a text file for data merge into either InDesign (IDML) or Map Creator (MAPX) master files.

                            <li>A red X indicates that the term is missing from this verse. If it's OK that it's missing, click the red X to deny that it's a problem.</li>
                            <li>A green checkmark with a small red X indicates that you've examined the verse and denied that the missing rendering is the problem.</li>

                    </li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>For the map you wish to typeset, open the downloaded InDesign file which does NOT have "@en" or other language code as part of the filename. (All maps are now distributed as .idml files instead of the usual .indd. This format is supported back to CS4.)</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>InDesign maps in SMP1 no longer have links to separate artwork files. All content is embedded directly in the .idml file.</p>
                    
                    <ol start="2">
                        <li>If your maps use a Roman-based writing system, all you'll need to do is ensure that the <a href="https://software.sil.org/charis/download/">Charis SIL</a> and <a href="https://software.sil.org/andika/download/">Andika</a> fonts are installed on your system. If you receive a message that you have missing fonts, simply install the versions of these fonts that can be found in the "Document fonts" subfolder in the top level of "SIL Maps Repository".</li>
                        
                        <li>Many of these InDesign maps support multiple options within one IDML file, most often the map type (such as "full color relief" or "black & white flat") and sometimes other variations (such as "complex routes" vs "simple routes" on the Exodus map). You can manually toggle layers to get the variation you're wanting. Note that some paragraph styles like "Ocean" and "Region" use color swatches named "Water color" and "Region color", and if you're wanting a black & white map, you'll need to change these paragraph styles to use the swatches named "Water BW" and "Region BW" instead. However, there's a better option: You can install the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HjbQR9Q1zXQq_S0_xfODlRk2jovf8GHTKxWJuR5oBp4/edit?usp=sharing">MapMonkey</a> script, and run this whenever you want to "monkey" with the map options, either before or after the data merge. For example, you might want a black & white map for your print publication, but the color version of it for your Scripture app. For more information, visit the <a href="http://tiny.cc/mapmonkey">MapMonkey</a> page.</li>
                        
                        <li>If your maps use a non-Roman writing system, you will need to ensure that the definitions of the <code>font1</code> and <code>font2</code> paragraphs styles specify the font and any other properties that are required for proper rendering. All styles used for labels inherit the writing system properties from these two styles.
                            <ol>
                                <li>Example: For a map that uses Devanagari script and Western digits, in the <code>font1</code> and <code>font2</code> paragraph styles, set the font to <a href="https://software.sil.org/annapurna/download/">Annapurna SIL</a>, set the justification to "Adobe World-Ready Paragraph Composer", and set the language to "Hindi".
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Alternatively, for this particular case, you may simply <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+import+all+text+styles+in+indesign">import these paragraph definitions</a> from the <code>Deva_AnnapurnaSIL_WesternDigits.indd</code> file which can be found in the <code>!Styles</code> folder at the root of the map repository.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>If the fonts that you are using do not have native bold and/or italic faces, you will need to edit the respective paragraphs styles (e.g. <code>font1 bold italic</code>) to fake the face appropriately, such as by adding a very slight outer stroke to fake bold, and/or skew for italics.</li>
                                <li>The <code>Regions</code> paragraph style typically employs expanded tracking in Roman-script projects, but the amount of expansion may be inappropriate in other writing systems. For this reason, you can modify the <code>expanded</code> character style to set an appropriate tracking property.</li>
                                <li>If your writing system uses a numeral system supported natively by InDesign, (that is, Bengali, Burmese, Devanagari, Farsi, Full Farsi, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Eastern Arabic ["Hindi"], Kannada, Khmer, Lao, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, or Tibetan), it will not be necessary to manually replace the Western digits on the map (such as for the scale) with local digits. InDesign can render the normal digit characters (codepoints U+0030 to U+0039) as if they were in various other numeral systems, without needing to replace the actual numerical characters. The <code>!AllDigitStyles.indd</code> file (which can likewise be found in the <code>!Styles</code> folder) contains a paragraph style for each of these numeral systems. By loading a style from that document into your map, and basing a style in that document on this style, you can control the digit system that InDesign uses to render normal digits.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>For example, for a map that uses Devanagari script and Devanagari digits, import the <code>devanagari digits</code> paragraph style into your map from the <code>!AllDigitStyles.indd</code> file, and then base the definition of <code>font1</code> and <code>font2</code> on this paragraph style.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Alternatively, for this particular case, you could import all paragraph styles from the <code>Deva_AnnapurnaSIL_DevaDigits.indd</code> file into your map.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Once you have set up your <code>font1</code> and <code>font2</code> styles appropriately for your writing system, save a copy of this document to be used as the import source for all maps. If it could be helpful for other typesetters who may use the same writing system, please submit a copy to the repository manager at <a href="mailto:maps-illustrationsrepository_intl@sil.org">maps-illustrationsrepository_intl@sil.org</a>.</li>

                    <ol start="5">
                        <li>If you have all the needed fonts installed on your computer but you are still seeing a pink highlight behind your text, that is an indication that your font is still missing.

                        <li>If you choose a map that has a black & white layer available, you can either apply the bw version of the styles to the appropriate layers or redefine the "<code>Regions</code>", "<code>Water</code>", "<code>Ocean</code>", and "<code>Seas</code>" paragraph styles to use the "BW" versions of the color swatches.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Make a copy of the repository map (.idml) to work from. We recommend saving the file in the project \\local\\figures directory and prefixing the file with project name. Allow InDesign to change the extension to .indd.

                        <li>Go to the InDesign menu item "Window" and navigate to "Utilities". Choose "Data Merge" from the fly-out menu. Go to the Panel Menu icon (stacked horizontal lines in the upper right corner of the Data Merge panel) <img src="images/image_B10.png" alt="Panel Menu Icon" style="vertical-align: middle; max-height: 20px;"> and choose "Select Data Source."</li>
                        
                        <li>The data source files for each map will be found in the Paratext Projects \\local\\figures folder, unless you specified another destination. It is a text (.txt) file with the same name as the map (including .idml), prefixed by the project name. For example, <code>luctest_155wbt - Holy Land.idml.txt</code> The list should populate the Data Merge panel.</li>

                            <p>Using the Selection tool (top arrow in the toolbox), select any text boxes that have a red "X" that indicates there is overset text. You can also check for overset text by looking at the Preflight Panel indicator at the bottom of your InDesign window:</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Reposition and resize any text boxes as needed. Resizing is most easily done with ctrl-alt-c (Fit frame to content) and the height and width menus in the control panel. Of course you can click and drag as well. You can adjust the font size of an individual entry or change the paragraph style so that you adjust the size of all of the "cities", for example. Either can be appropriate at different times.</p>
                    
                    <p>Any fields that appear to be surrounded by "??" are verses that contained no text in the XX book, i.e. they were overlooked or skipped by the translators. Once they enter the required text, you will need to re-merge per below, "Repeating the Merge Cycle." Whenever you see "OMIT", simply delete it and hide any corresponding information (like the Mile scale) by un-ticking that layer. In the SMP1 collection, removing dots for deliberately missing cities is easy, as there is now a separate InDesign object for each dot.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now is the time - still in preview mode - to make any other cosmetic changes to the map, as needed by the current project.</p>
                    
                    <p>The cosmetic changes in mind are changing the visibility of various layers, changing style attributes, and/or moving text labels. You should not make changes directly to the preview text, not even inserting a line break to wrap long text, as such changes will not be preserved when doing the data merge. Rather, if you need a long label to be wrapped, you should change the dimensions and/or other properties of the text frame and/or paragraph. E.g. Change the text frame's object style to "multiline". (Note that the paragraph's "Balance Ragged Lines" setting, which affects wrapping, is turned on, as inherited from the <code>font1</code> style.) It is recommended that you keep the data merge panel open so that InDesign will prevent you from mistakingly editing the preview text. Unless the data merge panel is open, the document will behave just like an already-merged document, with editable labels. (It will be possible AFTER step 6 in Repeating the Merge Cycle to edit the text and preserve the change, but it is hoped that little of that will be needed.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Note that we have found that it is NOT necessary to actually use the Merge button and create a second, merged InDesign file at this point. If you save and export to jpg or to pdf with Preview mode turned on, the files will be quite usable at this point. We do recommend doing the final merge step and saving that file after you are certain the team will make no more label changes. (See Repeating the Merge Cycle below).</p>

                    <p>Export your file as a *.jpg file at this time also and use this file to insert \\fig information into the Paratext Project at the appropriate locations.

                    <p>Now you should have two map files in your project IDENTICALLY NAMED except for their extensions.

                    <p>After each round of team proofing, there will typically be text and spelling changes the need to be re-merged into the project maps:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Re-export the data merge files.</li>
                        <li>For each affected map, open the master file copy (.indd) and "Update data source" on the Merge Tool menu.</li>
                        <li>Save each revised map according to "Export Map Merge Files", replacing the previous vernacular (.indd) file.</li>
                        <li>When the team has fully approved the maps and no more map label changes are expected, you can complete the final step of "Merging" the document and creating a second InDesign file with the labels actually embedded in the file.</li>
                        <li>Choose "Create Merged Document" from either the Panel Menu or the "Merge Data" icon located just below the Panel Options icon.</li>
                        <li>The Create Merged Document dialogue box will open. The default settings will suffice; click OK when prompted. Note: While performing the Merge task, your merged data will appear to revert back to the generic data fields, but it is still there. Once the Data Merge is completed, a new InDesign file with a "-1" added to the name will be generated. <strong>We recommend your saving this file as an .idml file and removing the -1</strong>. That way the files are identically named and you have not overwritten your mergeable .indd file. The merged .idml file will preserve the data more safely for long term archiving.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>InDesign maps (.indd files) should be placed directly into InDesign Scripture documents. Publishing Assistant should automatically place any map which has been formatted in Paratext using the \\fig markup and is located in the Paratext project's local/figures folder. Occasionally, you may still see the jpg being placed instead of your .indd. The best way to fix this is to ascertain the exact location of the \\fig markup in Paratext and go to that location in the InDesign file. Edit the fig markup and change the filename to have the .indd extension. In PA6 jobs, you can find it using the Text Editor (ctrl-y). In PA7 jobs, figure markup is found in the Conditional Text Panel Menu. Make the "Hidden Illustration" text visible by clicking in the first column on that line, edit the markup, and turn off visibility again. In both cases, carefully verify that the hidden attributes apply to your new edits. Then use PubAssist to place the picture again.</li>
                        <li>When maps are placed directly in the Scripture text, they should have the title layer turned off and the title should be included instead in the caption and reference sections of the Paratext markup as appropriate. Revisit all the maps after final validation to make sure they (and the gutter rule) still look ok.</li>
                        <li>You may export the merged map to the jpg and PDF formats after final validation. The PDF is useful for archiving.</li>
                        <li>When archiving the final publication files, make sure to archive the local/figures folder as well.</li>
